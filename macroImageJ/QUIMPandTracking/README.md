For QUIMP tracking:
Expected output file:
Positive/negative for red | Red intenisty level for checking | Imposed Flow in Dyn| Tracking: accumated distance| Tracking: Euclidean distance[ Number of time points| Euclidean speedaverage ruffling| Average ruffling on 95% faster| 75%| 50 %

ROI for cell seg should be saved
Expected input files
Draw the cell ; Give the flow intensity, and the frame when flow change

WARNING: working only with Fiji including ImageJ 1.51w, NOT ABOVE (quimp command line problem)

FOR AssociateMapwithCells
Launch the macro, indicate the directory containing xmap,ymap, and motilitymap, and cropcelltest.tif (see datatest)
Adjust contrast or LUT BEFORE clicking OK 
Click on one of th emap to see the spatial position and the time point on the cell.
