This plugin computes on a full image or on a set of ROIs (cell by cell for example) the coefficient of Pearson between two images, and a new image called Product of the Difference from the Mean (PDM), with two channels, one called positive for the part of the image where there is more colocalization, and one called negative, for the one with anti colocalization.
